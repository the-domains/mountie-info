As police officers we are trained to engage and overcome, both the legitimate and perceived threats to the public we are sworn to protect. Today, members of the RCMP face a new threat, the ability for our employers, the Commissioner and Treasury Board, to unilaterally roll back wages and/or benefits with no opposition. The threat is no collective voice to speak for members on terms and conditions of employment like pay, benefits, promotions, transfers etc. This sets us back 50 years in terms of labour relations with our employers. We need to react accordingly to contain/eliminate this threat to the general membership.

WE must act NOW. Together not only can we contain this threat, but we can push forward and ensure that the members of this organization are adequately supported, represented and compensated while serving the public they have sworn to protect.

**These are the Quick Facts:**  
-- January 16, 2015 the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) released its decision in MPAO v. Attorney General of Canada. This SCC directed the Federal Government to implement legislative changes, within one year, to allow for members of the RCMP to certify a bargaining agent.

-- December 8th, 2015 the newly elected Federal Government applied to the SCC for a 6 month extension to the one year deadline in order to draft, table and pass the required legislative changes to the Public Service Labour Relations Act (PSLRA) to comply with the MPAO decision.

-- On January 15th, 2016, the SCC granted the Federal Government a 4 month extension to table and pass legislation providing the framework for certification of a bargaining agent for members of the RCMP.

-- On January 16th, 2016 the Commissioner of the RCMP announced the creation of a new Member Workplace Services Program (MWSP) that will assist and guide members in the labour relations world as an interim model until a bargaining agent can be certified.

The simple problem with the MWSP, designed, implemented and managed exclusively by RCMP management, is that members have no collective voice -- it is individual assistance/guidance only, there is no collective. Members will have no national representation on issues such as pay, health benefits, occupational safety and NCO promotion process to name a few. This takes us back several decades. This MWSP does not provide meaningful labour relations in any way and the membership cannot sit idly by, we must stand up with the right organization that has the necessary experience, passion and integrity.

**We ask you:**Do you trust RCMP management and Treasury Board to have your best interests at heart when making unilateral decisions regarding (to name a few):  
Pay;  
Benefits (health/dental);  
Transfers & Promotions;  
Member Safety;  
Isolated Posts;  
Sick Leave;  
Kit and clothing (equipment);

As members, we are trained to take action -- we have been placed in a corner and there is only one option to represent your regional, national, contract and federal interests -- we need to take action and ensure that there is a voice for the membership of the RCMP at all tables that discuss terms and conditions of employment. Every day that passes, gives RCMP management the opportunity to roll back and change benefits without opposition. We need to act now!

We will be your voice. Join the National Police Federation now!
